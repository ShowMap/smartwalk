Collection cells fixed to be BIG.
Couple of splash-screens were added.

SW-160 Even better loading state handling.
Some code reverted again, but now we hide ListView only on first loading if there is no data. After that it's always visible to do not break Pull-To-Refresh UX. Animation is turned on for loading data moment in OrgEventView.

SW-160 Another update for initial view states
The state with no content is better supported. Now you can Pull-To-Refresh again and again to see if the content available.
Some obsolete code with hiding ListView was removed. This removes the nice fade in effect on content loading, but it was too much of state to carry for this feature.
OrgEventView is updated with better state managment too. Map is always hidden if there is no content.

SW-234 Basic deeplinking was supported.
Events / Host / Event views are opened upon a proper request from the external apps / browser.

SW-233 Fix for missing cache, UX improvements

ScrollToTop only runs after user's pull-to-refresh action.
